## Terraform Workflow

- **`terraform init`** – Downloads the required plugins and providers for your configuration.  
- **`terraform plan`** – Shows the execution plan, i.e., what resources will be created, changed, or destroyed.  
- **`terraform apply`** – Provisions the resources as defined in your configuration (requires confirmation by typing `yes`).  
- **`terraform destroy`** – Removes all resources managed by the current Terraform configuration.
